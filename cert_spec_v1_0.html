<h1>MILP certificate file format version 1.0</h1>

<h2>Preliminaries</h2>
<p>
Before we describe the mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) 
certificate <a href="#ff">file format</a>, we introduce some jargon
and conventions used in this document.
</p>

<h3>Variable indices</h3>
<p>
Variables of the MILP problem are indexed from \(0\) to \(n-1\)
where \(n\) is the total number of variables.
Throughout this document, \(X_i\) refers to the variable indexed by 
\(i\) regardless of its actual variable name.
</p>


<h3>Numbers</h3>
<p>
We refer to two kinds of numbers: indices and values.
Indices are integers.  Values are rational
numbers expressed as finite decimals or fractions.
</p>

<h3>Constraints</h3>
<p>
The certificate file includes two kinds of constraints: 
the constraints of the MILP problem and derived constraints.
Constraints have unique constraint names and are
assigned indices starting from \(0\) according to the order 
in which they appear in the certificate file.
</p>
<p>
Each constraint is of the form
\[a_{i_1} X_{i_1} + \cdots + a_{i_p} X_{i_p}~\texttt{sense}~\beta\]
where \(\texttt{sense}\) is \(=\), \(\leq\), or \(\geq\),
\(\beta\) is a rational value,
\(p \in \{1,\ldots,n\}\), and for \(j = 1,\ldots,p\),
\(i_j\) is a variable index, 
\(X_{i_j}\) is the variable with index \(i_j\), and
\(a_{i_j}\) is a rational value.
</p>
<p>
Bound constraints such as \(0 \leq X_1 \leq 1\) are not treated
specially.
</p>

<h3>Rounding</h3>
<p>
Suppose that the constraint
\[a_{i_1} X_{i_1} + \cdots + a_{i_p} X_{i_p}~\texttt{sense}~\beta,\]
where \(\texttt{sense}\) is \(\leq\) or \(\geq\), is such that
for \(j = 1,\ldots, p\),  \(a_{i_j}\) is an integer and
is nonzero only if \(i_j\) is an integer variable index,
then the constraint
\[a_{i_1} X_{i_1} + \cdots + a_{i_p} X_{i_p}~\texttt{sense}~\beta'\]
with \[\beta' = \left\{\begin{array}{ll} 
\lfloor \beta \rfloor & \text{if } \texttt{sense} \text{ is } \leq\\
\lceil \beta \rceil & \text{if } \texttt{sense} \text{ is } \geq\\
\end{array}\right.\]
is said to be obtained from rounding.
</p>


<h3>Domination of constraints</h3>
<p>We use a restricted form of constraint domination.</p>
<p>A constraint that is \(0 \geq \beta\) with
\(\beta \gt 0\) , \(0 \leq \beta\) with \(\beta \lt 0\), or
\(0 = \beta\) with \(\beta \neq 0\) is called an absurdity
or falsehood.  Such a constraint dominates any other constraint.
<p>
The constraint
\(a^\mathsf{T} x \geq \beta\) 
or \(a^\mathsf{T} x = \beta\) 
dominates \({a'}^\mathsf{T} x \geq \beta'\) if
\(a = a'\) and \(\beta \geq \beta'\).
</p>
<p>
Similarly, the constraint
 \(a^\mathsf{T} x \leq \beta\) 
or \(a^\mathsf{T} x = \beta\) 
dominates \({a'}^\mathsf{T} x \leq \beta'\) if
\(a = a'\) and \(\beta \leq \beta'\).
</p>
<p>
Finally, the constraint \(a^\mathsf{T} x = \beta\) dominates 
\({a'}^\mathsf{T} x = \beta'\) if
\(a = a'\) and \(\beta = \beta'\).
</p>


<h3>Suitable linear combination of constraints</h3>
<p>
For a constraint named \(C\), define 
\(l(C)\) to be the left-hand-side of \(C\), 
\(r(C)\) to be the right-hand side of \(C\), and
\[s(C) = \left\{\begin{array}{cl} 
1 & \text{if } C \text{ is a } \geq\text{-constraint} \\
0 & \text{if } C \text{ is an } =\text{-constraint} \\
-1 & \text{if } C \text{ is an} \leq\text{-constraint}.
\end{array}\right.\]
</p>
<p>
For example, for the constraint \(C1:~7X_1 - 2X_2 \leq 5\),
we have
\[l(C1) = 7X_1 - 2X_2,~ r(C1) = 5,~s(C1) = -1.\]
</p>
<p>
Let \(C_1,\ldots, C_k\) be constraint names.
Let \(\lambda_1,\ldots, \lambda_k\) be values such that
\(\lambda_j s(C_j) \geq 0\) for all \(j = 1,\ldots, k\),
or \(\lambda_j s(C_j) \leq 0\) for all \(j = 1,\ldots, k\).
</p>
Then \(\lambda_1\cdot C_1 +\cdots + \lambda_k \cdot C_k\) 
is called a suitable linear combination and denotes the constraint
\[\left\{\begin{array}{ll}
\displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^k \lambda_i l(C_i) = \sum_{i=1}^k \lambda_i r(C_i) &
  \text{if } \lambda_j s(C_j) = 0 \text{ for all } j = 1,\ldots, k\\
\displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^k \lambda_i l(C_i) \geq \sum_{i=1}^k \lambda_i r(C_i) &
\text{if } \lambda_j s(C_j) \geq 0 \text{ for all } j = 1,\ldots, k
\text{ and } \lambda_q s(C_q) \neq 0 \text{ for some } q \in \{1,\ldots,k\} \\
\displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^k \lambda_i l(C_i) \leq \sum_{i=1}^k \lambda_i r(C_i) &
\text{if } \lambda_j s(C_j) \leq 0 \text{ for all } j = 1,\ldots, k.
\text{ and } \lambda_q s(C_q) \neq 0 \text{ for some } q \in \{1,\ldots,k\} \\
\end{array}
\right.
\]

<a id="cf"><h2>Constraint format</h2></a>
<p>
Specifying a constraint 
\[a_{i_1} X_{i_1} + \cdots + a_{i_p} X_{i_p}~\texttt{sense}~\beta\]
in constraint format means
listing the details of the constraint in the following order:
the constraint name, then the character representing 
\(\texttt{sense}\) (<code>E</code> when \(\texttt{sense}\) is \(=\), 
<code>L</code> when \(\texttt{sense}\) is \(\leq\), 
<code>G</code> when \(\texttt{sense}\) is \(\geq\)),
then \(\beta\), then 
<ul>
<li><p>\(p~~i_1~~a_{i_1}~~\cdots~~i_p~~a_{i_p}\);
</p></li>
<li><p> or the keyword <code>OBJ</code> for indicating that 
\(a_{i_1} X_{i_1} + \cdots + a_{i_p} X_{i_p}\)
is the same as the objective function.
</p></li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
For example, the constraint \(-7 X_2 + 4 X_5 \leq -1\) with constraint
name <code>C3</code> specified in constraint format is 
<pre><code>C3 L -1  2  2 -7  5 4</code></pre>
If the objective function specified in the certificate file is equal to
\(-7 X_2 + 4 X_5\), no matter whether to be minimized or maximized, then
we may also write the shorter form
<pre><code>C3 L -1 OBJ</code></pre>
</p>

<a id="rf"><h2>Reason format</h2></a>
<p>
Every constraint in the <a href="#der">
<code>DER</code> section</a> specified below
is associated with a \(\texttt{reason}\).
</p>
<p>
A \(\texttt{reason}\) associated with a constraint with constraint
index \(\texttt{idx}\) must have one of the following forms:
<ul>
<li><p> 
\(\{~\texttt{asm}~\}\)
</p></li>

<li><p> 
\(\{~\texttt{lin}~~p~~i_1~~\lambda_1~~\cdots~~i_p~~\lambda_p~\}\)
where \(p\) is a nonnegative integer,
\(i_1,\ldots,i_p\) are distinct indices at least \(0\) and less than
\(\texttt{idx}\), and \(\lambda_1,\ldots,\lambda_p\) are rational values
such that \(\lambda_1 \cdot C_{i_1} + \cdots + \lambda_p \cdot C_{i_p}\)
is a suitable linear combination that dominates
the associated constraint;
here \(C_{i_j}\) denotes the constraint with index \(i_j\) for
\(j = 1,\ldots,p\).
</p></li>

<li><p> 
\(\{~\texttt{rnd}~~p~~i_1~~\lambda_1~~\cdots~~i_p~~\lambda_p~\}\)
where \(p\) is a nonnegative integer,
\(i_1,\ldots,i_p\) are distinct indices
at least \(0\) and less than
\(\texttt{idx}\), and \(\lambda_1,\ldots,\lambda_p\) are rational values
such that \(\lambda_1 \cdot C_{i_1} + \cdots + \lambda_p \cdot C_{i_p}\),
is a suitable linear combination that can
be rounded and the rounded constraint
dominates the associated constraint;
again \(C_{i_j}\) denotes the constraint with index \(i_j\) for
\(j = 1,\ldots,p\).
</p></li>
 
<li><p>
\(\{~\texttt{uns}~~i_1~~\ell_1~~i_2~~\ell_2~\}\) 
where \(i_1\), \(\ell_1\), 
\(i_2\), \(\ell_2\)
are indices at least 0 and less than \(\texttt{idx}\) such that 
the constraints indexed by \(i_1\) and \(i_2\) 
both dominate the associated constraint 
and the constraints indexed by \(\ell_1\) and \(\ell_2\)
are, perhaps after reordering,
\[a_{i_1} X_{i_1} + \cdots + a_{i_p} X_{i_p}~\leq~\beta\]
and
\[a_{i_1} X_{i_1} + \cdots + a_{i_p} X_{i_p}~\geq~\beta+1\]
such that \(\beta\) is an integer and
for \(j = 1,\ldots, p\), \(a_{i_j}\) is an integer and
\(X_{i_j}\) is an integer variable.
</p></li>
</ul>
</p>


<a id="ff"><h2>File format</h2></a>
<p>
The initial lines of the file may be comment lines.  Each comment line
must begin with the character &ldquo;%&rdquo;.
</p>
<p>
The first line, after the comment lines, must be 
<pre>
<code>VER 1.0</code>
</pre>
indicating that the certificate file conforms to version 1.0 of 
the certificate file format.
</p>

<p>The remaining content is divided into seven sections
and must appear in the order below:</p>
<h3>
<code>VAR</code> section</h3>
<p>The section begins with</p>
<p><code>VAR</code> \(n\)</p>
<p>
where \(n\) is the number of variables,
then followed by the \(n\) variable names separated
by spaces or line breaks.
</p>
<p>The variables are assigned indices from
\(0\) to \(n-1\) according to the order in which
the variable names are listed.
</p>

<h3><code>INT</code> section</h3>
<p>The section begins with</p>
<p><code>INT </code>\(i\)</p>
<p>
where \(i\) is the number of integer variables,
then followed by the \(i\) integer variable indices separated
by spaces or line breaks.
</p>
<p>
For example, the following specifies three variables
<code>x</code>, <code>y</code>, and <code>z</code> among which
<code>x</code> and <code>z</code> are the only integer variables:
<pre><code>VAR 3
x y z
INT 2
0 2
</code></pre>
</p>

<h3><code>OBJ</code> section</h3>
<p>
The section begins with</p>
<p><code>OBJ</code>  \(\texttt{objsense}\)</p>
<p>where \(\texttt{objsense}\) is the keyword <code>min</code>
for minimization or <code>max</code> for maximization, then followed by
an integer \(k\) and \(2k\) numbers
\[i_1~~c_1~~i_2~~c_2~~\cdots~~i_k~~c_k\]
separated by spaces or line breaks
where for \(j = 1,\ldots, k\), \(i_j\) is a variable index and 
\(c_k\) is the objective function coefficient for the variable with
index \(i_j\).
</p>

<p>
For example, the <code>OBJ</code> section for the problem

\[\begin{array}{rl}
\min & 7x +2y- 3z \\
\mbox{s.t.} 
& C1:~ x - 2z \leq \frac{2}{3}\\
& C2:~y + z = 1 \\
& x, y, z \geq 0
\end{array}\]
could look like the following:
<pre><code>OBJ min
3
0 7  1 2  2 -3
</code></pre>
</p>

<h3><code>CON</code> section</h3>
<p>
The section begins with </p>
<p><code>CON </code> \(m~~b\)<p>
<p>where \(m\) is the total number of constraints (including bound constraints)
and \(b\) is the total number of bound constraints,
and then followed by \(m\) constraints listed in 
<a href="#cf">constraint format</a>.
</p>
<p>The constraints in this section are assigned indices from
\(0\) to \(m-1\) according to the order in which
they are listed.
</p>
<p>
Bound constraints must appear at the end of the section
after the nonbound constraints.
</p>

<p>
For example, the <code>CON</code> section for the problem
\[\begin{array}{rl}
\min & x+y+ z \\
\mbox{s.t.} 
& C1:~ x - 2z \leq \frac{2}{3}\\
& C2:~y + z = 1 \\
& x, y, z \geq 0
\end{array}\]
could look like this:
<pre><code>CON 5 3
C1 L 2/3  2  0 1  2 -2
C2 E  1   2  1 1  2 1
x  G  0   1  0 1
y  G  0   1  1 1
z  G  0   1  2 1</code></pre>
Here, the variable names were used as constraint names for the bound constraints
though any program that outputs a certificate is free to choose other
names for the bound constraints.
</p>

<h3><code>RTP</code> section</h3>
<p>
The section is either</p>
<p><code>RTP infeas</code><p>
for indicating infeasibity, or
<p><code>RTP range </code>\(lb~~ub\)<p>
where \(lb\) specifies the lower bound on the optimal value
to be verified
and \(ub\) specifies the upper bound on the optimal value
to be verified.
The specified lower bound can be <code>-inf</code> if no actual
lower bound is to be verified and the specified upper bound can be
<code>inf</code> if no actual upper bound is to be verified.
</p>

For example, if the <code>RTP</code> section is
<pre><code>RTP range 5 inf</code></pre>
only a lower bound of \(5\) is to be verified.
</p>

<h3><code>SOL</code> section</h3>
<p>
The section begins with 
<p><code>SOL </code>\(s\)</p> 
where \(s\) is the number of solutions to be verified for feasibility, 
and then followed by 
</p>
<p>
\(\begin{array}{c}
S_1\\ \vdots \\S_s\end{array}\)
</p>
<p>
such that for \(j = 1,\ldots, s\),
\(S_j\) is of the form
\[\texttt{name}~~p~~i_1~~v_1~~\cdots~~i_p~~v_p\]
where \(\texttt{name}\) is the solution name, \(p\) is a nonnegative integer,
and for \(r = 1,\ldots,p\), \(i_r\) is a variable index and
\(v_r\) is the solution value for the variable with index \(i_r\).
All other variables are assumed to have the value zero.
</p>
<p>
At least one of the solutions specified should have objective function value
at least the lower bound given in the <code>RTP</code> section in the
case of maximization and at most the upper bound
given in the <code>RTP</code> section in the case of minimization.
</p>

<p>
For example, to specify the two solutions
\((x,y) = (1,2)\) and \((x,y) = (0, -1)\) where
\(x\) has variable index <code>0</code> and \(y\) has variable index 
<code>1</code>, the <code>SOL</code> section could look like this:
<pre><code>SOL 2
sol1 2  0 1  1 2
sol2 1  1 -1
</code></pre>
</p>

<a id="der">
<h3><code>DER</code> section</h3></a>
<p>
The section begins with
<p><code>DER </code>\(d\)</p>
<p>
where \(d\) is the number of derived constraints to be verified,
and then followed by
</p>
<p>
\(\begin{array}{c}
D_1\\ \vdots \\D_d\end{array}\)
</p>
<p>such that \(D_1,\ldots,D_d\) are assigned constraint indices from
\(m\) to \(m+d-1\) according to the given order 
and for \(j = 1,\ldots,d\), \(D_j\) is of the form
\[\texttt{constraint}~~\texttt{reason}~~\texttt{index}\]
where \(\texttt{constraint}\) is the constraint to be verified in 
<a href="#cf">constraint format</a>, 
\(\texttt{reason}\) is the reason associated with the constraint in 
<a href="#rf">reason format</a>, 
and \(\texttt{index}\) is \(-1\) or is 
an index such that no constraint with a larger index
refers to this constraint.
</p>
Each constraint in this section carries implicitly a set of assumptions
deduced as follows:
<ul>
<li><p>
If \(\texttt{reason}\) is \(\{~\texttt{asm}~\}\), then
the set of assumptions contains simply the index of the constraint.
</p></li>
<li><p>
If \(\texttt{reason}\) is
\(\{~\texttt{lin}~~p~~i_1~~\lambda_1~~\cdots~~i_p~~\lambda_p~\}\) or
\(\{~\texttt{rnd}~~p~~i_1~~\lambda_1~~\cdots~~i_p~~\lambda_p~\}\),
then the set of assumptions is the union of the 
sets of assumptions of the constraints indexed by \(i_1,\ldots,i_p\).
</p></li>
<li><p>
If \(\texttt{reason}\) is
\(\{~\texttt{uns}~~i_1~~\ell_1~~i_2~~\ell_2~\}\),
then the set of assumptions is the union of the 
sets of assumptions of the constraint indexed by 
\(i_1\) without \(\ell_1\) and of the constraint indexed by \(i_2\) without \(\ell_2\).
</p></li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
If the <code>RTP</code> section is <code>RTP infeas</code>, 
then the last constraint in this section should be an absurdity
with an empty set of assumptions.
</p>
<p>
If the <code>RTP</code> section is 
<code>RTP range </code>\(lb\) \(ub\), 
then the last constraint in this section should be
a constraint with an empty set of assumptions that dominates 
\(\mathsf{OBJ}\geq~lb\)
in the case of minimization or
\(\mathsf{OBJ}\leq~ub\)
in the case of maximization 
where \(\mathsf{OBJ}\) denotes the objective function.
</p>
<p>
<b>Remark.</b>
The reason for specifying \(\texttt{index}\) is to allow
a verifier to discard the corresponding constraint from memory 
once the verifier has completed verifying constraint with
index \(\texttt{index}\).
